#' Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine Trial
#'
#' The Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine Trial was a cluster randomized trial
#' carried out from 1997 to 2000 to assess the safety and efficacy of a
#' seven-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (O'Brien et al., 2003). The
#' study population was Navajo and White Mountain Apache children younger
#' than 2 years, a group with one of the highest documented rates of invasive
#' pneumococcal disease in the world at that time. A total of 38 geographic
#' areas were randomized: 19 areas were offered pneumococcal vaccine and 19
#' were offered a comparator (meningococcal vaccine). These data, made available
#' by Hayes and Moulton (2017) on Harvard Dataverse, include a
#' random subsample of 449 children drawn from the original 8,292 trial
#' participants.

#' The Botswana Combination Prevention Project
#'
#' The Botswana Combination Prevention Project (BCPP) was a pair-matched HIV
#' prevention CRT to test whether a combination treatment and prevention
#' intervention could reduce population-level cumulative HIV incidence over 3
#' years of follow-up. A total of 30 communities were randomized: 15 to the
#' intervention arm (combination treatment and prevention package) and 15 to
#' the control arm (enhanced standard of care). The primary study endpoint was
#' cumulative HIV incidence, measured at scheduled study visits as time to
#' HIV-infection within a cohort of individuals identified as HIV-negative among
#' a 20\% random sample of eligible households at baseline. That is, we have an
#' interval-censored time-to-event outcome for each cohort participant. Since
#' the primary trial results have not yet been published, this is a simulated
#' data set, which was generated to mimic the BCPP by applying an agent-based
#' epidemic model to a dynamic network of simulated sexual partnerships
#' (Goyal, Blitzstein, and De Gruttola, 2013; Wang et al., 2014).
