\description{
The Botswana Combination Prevention Project (BCPP) was a pair-matched HIV
prevention CRT to test whether a combination treatment and prevention
intervention could reduce population-level cumulative HIV incidence over 3
years of follow-up. A total of 30 communities were randomized: 15 to the
intervention arm (combination treatment and prevention package) and 15 to
the control arm (enhanced standard of care). The primary study endpoint was
cumulative HIV incidence, measured at scheduled study visits as time to
HIV-infection within a cohort of individuals identified as HIV-negative among
a 20\% random sample of eligible households at baseline. That is, we have an
interval-censored time-to-event outcome for each cohort participant. Since
the primary trial results have not yet been published, this is a simulated
data set, which was generated to mimic the BCPP by applying an agent-based
epidemic model to a dynamic network of simulated sexual partnerships
(Goyal, Blitzstein, and De Gruttola, 2013; Wang et al., 2014).
